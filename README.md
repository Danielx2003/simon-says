Smon Sys is a game where the user has to follow the sequence that is being printed, and type the first letter of the colour. For the game to get harder, the list gets 1 longer every round, and the time to think decreases from 1.5 seconds in the first round and minuses 0.05 every time. The text printed is in the colour of the colour. For example the text "red" is in the colour red so it is easier for the user to distinguish between the colours. When the user gets the sequence wrong, the game ends and displays the score.

To make the game better my next plan would be to add graphics so the sequence plays by boxes of the colour flashing and the user can click them as their inout.
